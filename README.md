pap is a paper threading tool for the command line. It offers a simple interface for adding metadata and querying reading status. The workflow is opinionated, dividing into four different stages and tailored to the author's use.

## Installation

You can install `pap` with

```
cargo install pap
```

## How-to use

Currently my reading is comprised of four stages:
 * I  - added but deeper understanding with more references is needed
 * II - read and compressed on a paper or whiteboard
 * III - recalled or explained to somebody else, looked into open-review
 * IV - feed-back from publication venue, textual results or reversed-citation graph
